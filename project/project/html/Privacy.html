                    or buy other
                    businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the
                    transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy
                    Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that
                    A1.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of
                    course be one of the transferred assets.
